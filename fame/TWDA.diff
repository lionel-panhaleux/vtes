 Deck Name:   Henry Twister
+
+BEN'S DECK NOTES:
+Around the time I was contemplating the EconoGhoul deck, I got into a
+conversation on the #vtes irc channel (irc.sorcery.net) with David
+Cherryholmes and others about Henry Taylor, and how obnoxious it can
+be to put a Protean skill card on him and playing Earth Meld to protect
+a Smiling Jack.  This seemed like a great application of the Pochtli
+Twister tech, so I decided to build the deck.  I used Dirty Contracts
+instead of Tracker's Marks, and included a Brothers Grimm, as the Dirty
+Contracts could be used to protect the Brothers Grimm.  Ruins of Villers
+Abbey, Belgium and Quick Meld are in there for combat defense, as they're
+extremely card-efficient sources of maneuvers (and the maneuvers from the
+Ruins can be paid for with The Rack).   Millicent Smith is there to slow
+the rate of table progression down, while speeding up the rate of turns,
+helping to buy clock time for the Smiling Jack to work.  I don't recommend
+using such a deck in a casual game.  As much as there are assorted ways of
+defeating this deck (Pentex Subersion, Immortal Grapple, Kiss of Ra, etc.),
+if the table doesn't have a way of getting past Henry, you'll be wasting
+2 hours of their time as they get to sit there and do nothing.  That's fine
+for a tournament, but not fine for a friendly game.  Props again to Keith
+Page, a former Boston player who built the original Pochtli Twister deck,
+of which my Pochtli Twister deck is its namesake, and Henry Twister is
+similarly named in its honor.

 Deck Name:   EconoGhoul
+
+BEN'S DECK NOTES:
+I'd been thinking about building a War Ghoul deck for a while, but
+acquiring the 10 of them that one needs for the usual 60-card version
+looked to be a pain in the neck.  So, I thought about applying the
+tech developed with the Pochtli Twister deck, building a version that
+was 30 or so cards, with half the War Ghouls, and padding out the deck
+with burn option cards.  This would save me from having to get more
+War Ghouls, and I figured that it'd be extremely rare that an ally
+rush decks would bring out 6 or more such allies anyway.  When Mata
+Hari was printed, I decided to build the deck, as she could take easy
+advantage of Waste Management Operation and I liked the superior
+Obfuscate.  Josh Feuerstein then clued me into the fact that the
+burn option cards could be D'habi Revenants, as they can be discarded
+via burn option, and Mata Hari could employ them for use in creating
+War Ghouls (though not for the bleed bonus).  I ran with the idea
+and included a variety of other burn option cards, such as Riddle
+Phantastique and Chanjelin Ward.  The deck proved to be highly
+effective, the only worry being that Mata Hari might get immediately
+rushed via Red List when she comes out, before a Secure Haven or
+Chanjelin Ward could be put on her.  As such I recommend dropping
+a couple Obfuscate stealth cards and including a couple copies of
+Mirror Image.  Another discovery was how solid it was to bring back
+Jake Washington via the Waste Management Operation, as it allows
+you to stop one rushing minion cold every turn.  Props to Josh
+Feuerstein for the D'habi Revenant idea, and to Ruben Vidana Ramos
+and Stephane Lavrut whose War Ghoul decks I used as references
+(and to Lasombra Jeff for the TWD Archive!).

 Second Guess Corral
 
+It's hardly the most original deck - it's based on Colin Riggs'
+winning deck from a recent DC tournament.  I just didn't like
+the fact that its only defensive option is to go upstream, so
+I dropped a few Bum's Rushes and the Computer Hackings and
+Arsons, and put in some wakes, bleed bounce/reduction, and light
+intercept.  It didn't run very consistently, and I think 9 or 10
+guns and 9 or 10 Concealed Weapons may be the way to go, as I
+had some difficulty getting a gun early on in a couple games.
+Some of the consistency problems were likely the result of the
+increased number of fight decks and reduced number of bleed decks,
+reducing the effectiveness of the defense.  The intercept did
+prove to be quite handy.
+
+Here's Colin Riggs' deck, for comparison:

+This deck is based on Jason Dawson's (of Seattle) weenie Auspex deck.
+It has been Jay-ified, however.  This deck won a four player tournament
+in Lansing MI in late October of 2002.  I waited to post it until it won
+at a larger (10 player) event :)  The Sniper Rifles are great against close

+I can afford Club Zombie because my vamps are cheap, and because it's hard

+
+PS: The day after the tournament my girlfriend and I flew from Pittsburgh to
+New Orleans for vacation.  Six days later Trent Rezner (of Nine Inch Nails)
+was on our flight back to Pittsburgh.  I wanted to give him a copy of Majesty
+with the Nine Inch Nails quote on it.  Unfortunately all I had on me were Cam.

 Deck: Monster's Ball
 
+Deck Notes:
+
+I've had a very good record with this deck in casual games, and now in a
+tournament. Its fairly straightforward, but a good bit of R&D went into
+testing and tuning it. Intercept combat. A nice layered defense of solid
+intercept (with an option to KO), light bounce, and Greta, mostly keeps
+you out of trouble.
+
+The Palla Grandes, with maybe help from Fame, give you a kicker to swoop
+in on your prey, and oust (maybe with Aire as the closer). The deck has
+enough juice to do this twice, but kind of runs out of ousting power after
+that.  But, typically, its just enough to win the table.
+
+I started thinking about this deck after having my sneaky decks shut down
+by intercept monsters in a few tournaments. Kind of -- If you can't beat

 "tzimisce - go: counterspell deck"
 
+notes:
+
+-- special thanks to jay kristoff, for his deck on thelasombra's site,
+which was the inspiration for this one, and to david d'avila-anderson,
+for his incredible articles on the subject of intercept-combat decks...
+-- i've been playing this deck for over a year now, in various forms,
+but it wasn't until bloodlines and 'read the winds' that i was able to
+really get it off the ground... the raw power and efficiency of that
+one card opened up so many card slots, which i was able to dedicate to
+forward pressure, without compromising my ability to fend off 4-on-1
+onslaughts turn after turn...
+-- in light of the lessons i learned at this tournament, i think i'll
+need to change the 2 anarch revolt to either 2 more smiling jack, or 2
+war ghoul... the anarch revolts organize the table against me too much,
+and turn my cross-table buddies into enemies... with smiling jack, they
+at least think twice before coming at me... removing 2 revolts also
+allows me to drop 2 of the eagle's sight, so maybe i'd go with 3 smiling
+jack, 3 war ghoul, and exchange the femur of toomler for one more
+revenant...
+-- i'm seriously considering swapping out the duplicate caliban in the
+crypt for either goratrix, matteus, omaya, or [most likely] jost
+werner... the duplicate crypt draw doesn't really hurt me much, but
+having jost's inherent stealth might make a big difference in some
+games...

--- special thanks to jay kristoff, for his deck on thelasombra's site,
-which was the inspiration for this one, and to david d'avila-anderson,
-for his incredible articles on the subject of intercept-combat decks...
--- i've been playing this deck for over a year now, in various forms,
-but it wasn't until bloodlines and 'read the winds' that i was able to
-really get it off the ground... the raw power and efficiency of that
-one card opened up so many card slots, which i was able to dedicate to
-forward pressure, without compromising my ability to fend off 4-on-1
-onslaughts turn after turn...
--- in light of the lessons i learned at this tournament, i think i'll
-need to change the 2 anarch revolt to either 2 more smiling jack, or 2
-war ghoul... the anarch revolts organize the table against me too much,
-and turn my cross-table buddies into enemies... with smiling jack, they
-at least think twice before coming at me... removing 2 revolts also
-allows me to drop 2 of the eagle's sight, so maybe i'd go with 3 smiling
-jack, 3 war ghoul, and exchange the femur of toomler for one more
-revenant...
--- i'm seriously considering swapping out the duplicate caliban in the
-crypt for either goratrix, matteus, omaya, or [most likely] jost
-werner... the duplicate crypt draw doesn't really hurt me much, but
-having jost's inherent stealth might make a big difference in some
-games...

 "The Waiting"
 
+Designer's Notes:
+
+This is the first time I've ever run this deck or anything like it. I
+attempted to build a deck that could survive long enough in a tournament
+environment in order to make a deal or two and then finish off my prey
+and maybe my grand prey in one huge flurry. Based on my
+previous tournament experience I figured I'd face alot of bleed and vote
+and not much rush/combat that didn't feature IG (in which case
+I'd be screwed anyway), hence the lack of combat cards. The idea is to
+generate enough blood to keep your pool away from any huge
+votes or bleeds, sudden or DI anything that's gonna hurt you real bad,
+try not to piss off the D-attackers, let your predator bleed your
+prey and wait for the moment to strike.
+
+The crypt features 7 votes and plenty of dominate for those
+deflections. Plus with 42 master cards out of 90 total, Anson is a MUST.
+Ulugh and Cardano are the Day Op finishers and Muaziz is versatility.
+You must be VERY patient playing this deck, you can't really go
+forward until you're ready to commit everything for the kill. I tried
+to rifle through the deck as quickly as possible (Storage
+Annex/Ulugh/Parthenon) and get the cards I need for the finisher locked
+in the annexes. All you're looking for is to get your prey down
+to 7 pool, then send Muaziz in to knock out any stoppers with a
+Revelations and then go for it!  Ultimately this is proof that a deck
+doesn't have to be some kind of "nasty creature" to win a tourney.

-Playing the deck: Never discard any of the 12 kill cards. Counter
-Blood gain with the Suddens. Use Revelations to remove Deflections or
-blood gain from your prey's hand as the first action per turn if
-possible. Depending on the deck use a Revelations about 1 in 3 turns.
-Get someone with superior obfuscate quite quickly to cloak actions.
-Remember that, largely, you suck at combat. Kill Mr. Winthrop or

+The idea behind the deck is simple:
+keep yourself alive, almost indefinitely, by bloating like crazy
+from the Blood Dolls / Hungry Coyote combination, supplemented by
+Govern the Unaligned and Scouting Mission at superior. After you
+have a suitable number of minions up and your prey is low enough
+in pool (less than twelve, heh), steamroll your prey with stealthed
++2/+1 bleeds from your four or five minions. Machiavelli sums it
+up nicely: "And here we must observe that men must either be
+flattered or crushed; for they will revenge themselves for slight
+wrongs; whilst for grave ones they cannot. The injury, therefore,
+that you do a man should be such that you need not fear for revenge."
+
+The weak spots of this deck, as with most focused decks, are numerous.
+The lack of intercept, with the exception of Angelica, is a major sore
+spot, which actually cost me two victory points in the final. Should
+anyone seek to replicate this deck, I suggest substituting a number
+of intercept cards in for the Redirections. A heavy-duty rush-combat
+deck with Immortal Grapple would tear this deck to shreds, as the
+maneuvers are light. Depending on your local metagame, replacement
+of a number of Shadow Step for Arms of the Abyss may be in order.
+The addition of a Power Structure, to defend against vote-based decks,
+would also benefit the deck greatly as it will often finish the game
+with four-plus minions.

 Robert Goudie's Weenie Obfuscate/Auspex deck
 
+COMMENTS:
+
+Well, first of all, I'm suprised at the contents now that I look at
+it.  The original version was more heavily weighted toward Night Moves.
+This is probably half as many as were in the first version.  I also
+removed all of the dodges and instead put more intercept.  I've always
+called it a night moves deck but that really doesn't describe it well
+anymore.  Let's call it a Weenie Obfuscate/Auspex deck.
+
+The crypt design is pretty obvious.  I put 2 of each vampire that had
+auspex+obfuscate.  I also put 2 of the 1 or 2 capacity vamps with
+obfuscate.  The auspex vamps are key.  I need to get at least one to
+start with.
+
+I think I'm pretty well known for really focussed decks (weenie dom bleed,
+weenie cryptic mission, weenie undead persistance, etc.) and this is
+somewhat of a departure.  They're still weenies but I put in a good
+number of cards that may or may not be useful. As it turned out, these
+additions that watered-down my stealth bleed were a big benefit to me.
+
+I believe I won with no library cards left so I had an opportunity to
+play all of the one-shot cards.  Delaying Tactics was used to save my bacon.
+The Malkavian Dementias were quite nasty and allowed me to take Lucian
+from my predator at a couple of key moments.  The Muddled was quite useful,
+as were the Haven Uncovered (I believe Paul made use of it to attack
+Jeff) and the Sudden Reversals.
+
+I essentially used my size to get a quick kill of my first prey.  Then,
+I had enough intercept to keep my next prey and my predator from killing
+me.  The neverending supply of stealthy bleeds eventually did the trick.

 Deck name:   Extreme Sports
 Description: Tremere push the pain for all it's worth...
 
+Instructions:
+1: If the tourney rules allow you, don't be afraid to strip this deck by as
+many as 30 cards...
+a) The gangrel de-evolutions are because gangrel's persistent small bleeds
+and many combat-ends cards are annoying.
+b) The strained vitae supplies are great against pleb-decks.
+c) Strip one Chainsaw and all Vast Wealth if you think the chainsaw is in
+danger from canine hordes.  If you think it may get stolen with fast
+hands... Keep it in! ;o)
+
+2: Try to save the bursts of sunlight for when you're blocking.  Or your
+opponent will just dodge of Combat ends.
+
+3: Dawn-op, weather control, skin of night :o)
+
+4: The chainsaw will start an entropic process, ending in your demise, or
+the chainsaw-bearer going to torpor...  Make sure you time its appearance so
+that you have won before it causes you to lose.  The restorations, the fifth
+trads, the chantry, and the masochism will all help to make the chainsaw as
+painless as possible.
+
+5: The Chainsaw can be used twice in a turn if you use Heidelburg.
+
+6: You *need* someone out with superior auspex if your predator is capable
+of large bleeds.
+
+7: You *can* survive for some time without a prince or justicar, but you'll
+probably need one for the end-game.
+
+8: Blood-dolls, restorations, fifth-trads, and the Arcane Library are your
+blood-generation, Bindusara has superior auspex and can get you the arcane
+library...
+
+Political Defense: Block them.
+S&B Defense: Deflect them until you can chop 'em up.
+Pleb Defense: Beat 'em up, and eat 'em.  Strained vitae supply.
+Combat Defense: Agg-damage (dawn op / Weather control, or block and wait for
+a good chance at Burst of sunlight, then be sure to diablerise them.

+Rob's Comments:
+
+"I wanted to try to show that my old faves can still rock
+and roll in a tournament arena. The deck harps back to the
+Ventrue Steamroller deck of GenCon97 with revisions for the
+7/7 rulings which DID NOT help the Ventrue [Pulled Fangs,
+Fame/Day Op, Tomb etc etc] needed to be done however.
+
+It fits in most of the "Classic Cards" as well as a slice
+of obfuscate in place of the multitude of Day Ops. The
+value of Master phases/cards are realised as they are laid
+down 2 at a time - no one can deny the effectiveness of a
+double Hostile in the right hands. Might take out the
+revelations, they are useful to get rid of intercept,
+wakes or power cards but more Daring the Dawn or Hostiles
+would be more useful. I like the crypt, obviously powervamp
+Arika and Queen Anne are the mainstay but either of the
+other princes with an obf skill card can kick ass. Lady
+Luck can boot you in the nuts with your draw of four but
+as long as one of the biggies come out you are ok.
+
+The deck has very little intercept. I tend to save the
+2nd Trads and the Rumor Mill for emergencies and rely on
+Hostiles, Banishments, Deflections and agitation as
+"offensive defense". It has a lot of powerful one-shot
+plays, biding your time, slotting together a good hand
+and playing it well can take out two or cripple three
+players in a turn. The deck is all about laying low and
+balancing tables then pouncing when you are very sure
+or taking a calculated risk [my kind of deck].
+
+I was impressed with [and scared by!] a couple of decks
+at the tourney. Niki's Trap/Undead Persistence deck was
+cool, I liked the obvious but overlooked inclusion of
+superior Dom. Will's horrible allies blender deck is
+great, the hurt comes from an unexpected source and the
+sheer numbers are hard to handle. 19 players. Could be
+wrong but no Malk. S&B decks, F* ***** Hooray."
+
+He's not wrong about the lack of cheese. Only one tap
+and bleed deck, too! It was also good to see Nathan's
